Create a more colourful version of this character sprite sheet from the ZX Spectrum game "Everyone's a Wally". 
You must maintain the size of the images and also the pink background, which is a transparency mask.
The sprites must be representative of the characters in the game and maintain the character and humour of the original sprite sheet.
Use only the colours available on the ZX Spectrum.
